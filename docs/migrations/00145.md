###Changes to expected SWOptionsToken values

**Before:**

```ts
type Options = {
  cacheInvalidatingPatterns?: Array<string>,
  cacheDuration?: number,
};
```

**After:**

* `cacheInvalidatingPatterns` is now `cacheBustingPatterns` and takes an array of regular expressions instead of an array of strings

* `cacheableRoutePatterns` is an additional option--when present, html requests that do not match at least one of these regular expression will bypass the Service Worker and always hit the network directly.

```ts
type Options = {
  cacheableRoutePatterns?: Array<RegExp>,
  cacheBustingPatterns?: Array<RegExp>,
  cacheDuration?: number,
};
```
